# Predictive Employee Turnover Analysis

In this project, I implemented a database schema in Google BigQuery to manage and analyze employee data for turnover prediction. I connected Google Colab to BigQuery for seamless data access and manipulation, enabling efficient analysis. A churn prediction model was built using PyCaret with a Random Forest classifier to identify at-risk employees. The results were exported back to BigQuery, and a Looker Studio dashboard was created to visualize turnover risks and explore key factors affecting employee retention.

## Tech Stack:
Google Cloud BigQuery, Python (Colab), PyCaret, Random Forest Classifier, Looker Studio
